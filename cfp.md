We encourage you to submit original work that emphasizes the role, application, and impact of visualization in data science. The workshop accepts archival full paper submissions for talks.

## Full Papers

Paper submissions should describe the role, application, and impact of visualization in data science. We would like to particularly encourage papers that cross disciplinary boundaries and show how visualization in data science can be a catalyst for discovery. Papers will be published in our symposium proceedings and published in the IEEE Digital Library. We consider papers as work in progress and encourage authors to publish an improved version of the paper in a journal or at another venue at a later time. In addition, we plan to publish extended versions of selected papers in a special issue of IEEE TVCG.

Papers that integrate visualization with any stages of the data science pipeline (collecting data, cleaning data, exploring data, and communicating data) would be welcome as submissions to VDS.


### Review Process (Single blind or Double blind)

Paper submissions will be managed by the Program Chairs and sent to the Program Committee to evaluate the work’s novelty and significance. You have the option to have your work reviewed via a double-blind process; to do this, simply be sure to exclude all identifying information in the submitted manuscript file, ensuring that the reviewers will not know the identity of the authors. Otherwise, the review process will be single-blind, i.e., the reviewers will know the identity of the authors, but the authors will not know the identity of the reviewers.


### Paper Submission and Formatting Guidelines (8 pages max excluding references)

Submissions should be no more than 8 pages long excluding references — shorter papers are welcome — and formatted according to the [VGTC formatting guidelines](http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Tasks/camera.html).

<!-- To submit a paper please use the [Precision Conference System](https://new.precisionconference.com/submissions).  -->

<!-- After logging in go to “new submissions” and select “Submit to Papers” for VDS 2020. -->
